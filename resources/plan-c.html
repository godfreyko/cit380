        <h1>Plan C details</h1>
        <hr />
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Plan C provides you with a planned project and all of the necessary
          documentation to complete it. It's purpose is twofold.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Prepare you to pass the PMI Certified Associate in Project
            Management (CAPM) exam.
          </li>
          <li>
            Provide a model of a structured project as an example of the
            principles studied while preparing for the exam.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Plan C is given to you as a fully planned project and as written
          assumes a one person team. Because of this it does not provide good
          opportunities to show growth in the first two outcomes of the course:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Be an effective communicator, team member, and leader, and</li>
          <li>
            Be proactive, able to operate in poorly defined or constrained
            situations
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          For this reason the maximum grade possible on Plan C is 80%. This plan
          is adaptable however. If a student adapts the plan in a way that can
          allow progress on the above outcomes, they become eligible to advance
          to a higher plan and potentially earn a higher grade.
        </p>
        <p>
          There will be a requirement for you to turn in a mid-project milestone
          report detailing your progress at the midpoint of your project, and a
          lessons learned report you will turn in at the end. The milestone
          report must be done no later than Week 6, the lessons learned report
          no later than week 12.
        </p>
        <p>
          These status reports should be submitted to the
          <strong>Project Milestone Report</strong> discussion board in ILearn.
        </p>
        <p>
          All changes to the plan should be discussed and ultimately approved by
          the instructor.
        </p>

        <h2>Additional information</h2>
        <p>
          A Project Management Plan (PMP) is a living document. You should
          review all of it's parts carefully, starting with the charter, so that
          you understand what is expected, and then you should also regularly
          update the plan as necessary while you execute it.
        </p>
        <p>
          There will also be an expectation for you to review other student's
          projects. You can evaluate the projects either at the half-way point
          using the milestone mid-project report, or at the end using the
          lessons learned.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can determine the format of this review, or you can look at common
          project post-mortem templates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Start early one these reviews. Early feedback to the owners of the
          projects will be much more useful than late feedback. Likewise you
          should seek out early feedback on your project. Because of the way the
          course is structured there is no guarantee that your project will get
          reviewed by a peer. You can seek these out! From classmates, family,
          co-workers, instructors, peers, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          The projects to review will be found in the
          <strong>Project Milestone Reports</strong> discussion board in ILearn.
          Post your review or post-mortem as a reply in that same place.
